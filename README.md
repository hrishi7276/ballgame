# ballgame
The  ball game is an simple game which uses accelerometer to move ball also its in beta stage since I'm new in android development,also game was hard for starters.I used AndEngine to build this game. This game was tested successfully in android 5.1.1 lollipop.
the game name was changed from the hardest game to the ball game for easy understanding whats that game about. this game was compiled and developed in android studio so i reccommends android studio if anyone wants to open this project.
Have fun :)
